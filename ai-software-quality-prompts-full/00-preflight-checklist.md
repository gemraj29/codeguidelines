# 00 – Pre-flight Checklist
(Short version)

Use this before asking any LLM to implement a feature:

- Clarify problem, users, and MVP scope.
- Clarify architecture layers (UI/API, services, domain, infra).
- Define main entities and fields.
- Define API shapes and error model.
- Call out performance/complexity constraints.
- Call out security/auth & logging expectations.
- Decide what tests are needed (unit, integration).
