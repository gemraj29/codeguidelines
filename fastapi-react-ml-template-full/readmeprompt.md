# readmeprompt.md – How to Use This Template Repo with Prompts

- This repo is a skeleton for a FastAPI backend, React + TS frontend, and ML pipeline.
- Place or reference your full prompt pack (from ai-software-quality-prompts-full.zip) in a `prompts/` folder here.
- Open the repo in your AI-assisted IDE (e.g., Cursor).
- Make sure `.cursorrules` (global rules) is configured, then:
  - Start a chat with the Master Super Prompt.
  - Let the model propose architecture.
  - After you approve, ask it to implement backend, frontend, and ML modules step by step, always following the rules.
